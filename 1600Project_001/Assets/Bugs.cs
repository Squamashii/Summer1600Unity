	Today we are going to talk about Bugs.
	
	Spiders. 
		Spiders are like, the worst bugs. They are in the arachnid family, and yeah, they are gross.
		Funny story.. The other day, my dad was talking to a spider on the window, trying to get it to crawl onto his hand so he could take it outside, but the spider was scared of him.
		Gross. Spiders are gross. Why do they come inside?
	Insects:
		Insects are the most common bugs you will see. This includes any bug with 3 body parts (Head, thorax, abdomen) and 6 legs.
		Recent discovery: I just found a short-winged blister beetle for the first time. It actually secreted blister juice when i nudged it with a stick! gross! I'm glad I didn't touch it with my hand.

	Worms:
	Worms are weird.. they don't have legs, or eyes! or really anything. They are just a worm.
	EarthWorms smile at you
