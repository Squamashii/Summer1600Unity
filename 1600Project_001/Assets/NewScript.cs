	Today we are going to talk about Bugs.
	
	Spiders. 
		Spiders are like, the worst bugs. They are in the arachnid family, and yeah, they are gross.
		Funny story.. The other day, my dad was talking to a spider on the window, trying to get it to crawl onto his hand so he could take it outside, but the spider was scared of him.




	Worms:
	Worms are weird.. they don't have legs, or eyes! or really anything. They are just a worm.
	When I was about 8 or 10 years old I had to disect an earthworm in school. They have a mouth, and they are always smiling! Talk about traumatizing. Skinning something that is smiling at you.
