	Today we are going to talk about Bugs.
	
	Insects:
		Insects are the most common bugs you will see. This includes any bug with 3 body parts (Head, thorax, abdomen) and 6 legs.
		Recent discovery: I just found a short-winged blister beetle for the first time. It actually secreted blister juice when i nudged it with a stick! gross! I'm glad I didn't touch it with my hand.
