<<<<<<<
	Spiders. 
		Spiders are like, the worst bugs. They are in the arachnid family, and yeah, they are gross.
		Funny story.. The other day, my dad was talking to a spider on the window, trying to get it to crawl onto his hand so he could take it outside, but the spider was scared of him.
=======
	Insects:
		Insects are the most common bugs you will see. This includes any bug with 3 body parts (Head, thorax, abdomen) and 6 legs.
		Recent discovery: I just found a short-winged blister beetle for the first time. It actually secreted blister juice when i nudged it with a stick! gross! I'm glad I didn't touch it with my hand.
